Input Format:  The first line will contain S 
Output Format: The first line will contain the count of articles in S. 

Boundary Conditions: The length of the string S will be from 3 to 1000. 
                     Each word in S will not be more than 100 characters. 

Example Input/Output 1:

    char s[1001][1001];
    int c=0, i=0;
    while(scanf("%s", &s[i])>0) i++;
    for(int j=0; j<i; j++){
        if(strcmp(s[j], "a")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "an")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "the")==0 || /*strcmp(s[j], "A")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "AN")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "THE")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "An")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "The")==0*/ strcmp(s[j], "a,")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "an,")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "the,")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "a.")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "an.")==0 || strcmp(s[j], "the.")==0 )
